### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/32Rsnaq)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 16 ounces gnocchi
- 13.5 ounce [can full fat coconut milk](http://amzn.to/2FNg4yH)
- 1/3 cup [vegetable broth](https://amzn.to/3f6ff6U)
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1/2 teaspoon dried sage
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon salt more or less to taste
- few shakes ground black pepper
- 2 cups loosely packed chopped kale or spinach

### Instructions

- Heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds or so, until fragrant.
    
- Add the gnocchi to the pan, along with the coconut milk, broth, pumpkin puree, dried sage, thyme, salt and black pepper. Stir everything together, breaking up the gnocchi if they're stuck together.
    
- Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Stir occasionally.
    
- Stir in the kale or spinach and cook until wilted. The gnocchi should be cooked through but not mushy, and the sauce thickened.
    
- Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep for 3-4 days in the refrigerator, and if needed it can be frozen, though the gnocchi will get quite mushy so it's best eaten fresh.
    

### Notes

1. You could make your own homemade [vegan pumpkin gnocchi](https://sweetsimplevegan.com/pumpkin-gnocchi/) instead of potato gnocchi, for an even more pumpkin dish!
    
2. Optional: add 2-3 vegan sausages, sliced. Pan fry them in the olive oil before the garlic.
