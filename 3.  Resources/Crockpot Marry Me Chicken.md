### Ingredients

#### For the chicken:

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- 2 Tablespoons butter

#### For the sauce:

- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- 3 Tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 cup heavy cream **(READ NOTES BELOW FIRST!)**
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ⅓ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes, drained
- ½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
- 10 fresh basil leaves, chopped

### Instructions

- In a small bowl, mix together: 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Season 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts on both sides with the seasoning mix.
    
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tablespoons olive oil and 2 Tablespoons butter (allow the butter to melt.)
    
- Sear the chicken breasts until golden brown, take the pan off the heat, and set aside. Note: You are not cooking the chicken all the way, you just want it brown on both sides. Turn off the heat but keep the leftover oil and butter in the pan (you'll use that in a bit)
    
- Whisk together 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and 3 Tablespoons cornstarch in a bowl until there are no lumps.
    
- Add the chicken broth mixture to the bottom of an 8-quart slow cooker.
    
- Whisk in 1 cup heavy cream **(see my notes below)**, 4 cloves garlic, minced, 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon paprika.
    
- Place the seared chicken breasts into the slow cooker and pour the olive oil and butter from the pan on top.
    
- Top each piece of chicken with the **chopped sun-dried tomatoes**. Place on low for 6-7 hours (do not cook on high - see my notes below.)
    
- Take the chicken breasts out and whisk in 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker, cover with sauce and add 10 fresh basil leaves, chopped to the top and then serve.
