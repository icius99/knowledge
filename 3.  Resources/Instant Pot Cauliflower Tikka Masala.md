**Servings:** 4

### Ingredients

-   1 tbsp vegan butter or oil
-   1 medium onion diced
-   3 cloves of garlic minced
-   1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
-   2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves
-   2 tsp garam masala
-   1 tsp turmeric
-   1/2 tsp ground chili
-   1/4 tsp ground cumin
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes with their juice
-   1 tbsp maple syrup
-   1 small cauliflower head cut into florets (about 4 cups florets)
-   1/2 cup non-dairy yogurt (or cashew cream)
-   optional toppings: fresh parsley roasted cashews

### Instructions

 

1.    Set the Instant Pot to sauté mode for 7 minutes. Add the oil. Once hot, add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the onions start to caramelize and become soft. Add the dried fenugreek leaves, garam masala, turmeric, chili, cumin, and salt. Continue to cook for another 2 minutes, stirring regularly to make sure it doesn't burn. Add a couple of tablespoons of water and scrape the bottom to make sure nothing is sticking to it, this will prevent the Instant Pot from giving you a "burn" message.
    
2.    Add the crushed tomatoes, maple syrup, and cauliflower florets. Secure the lid and close the vent to Sealing. Press the Pressure Cook button and adjust the time to 2 minutes. The Instant Pot will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure, then cook under pressure for 2 minutes.
    
3.    Once the program is finished and you have heard the beeps, wait 1 minute and release the pressure. Stir in the non-dairy yogurt and stir to combine.
    
4.   Serve hot with rice, naan, or tofu, and top with fresh parsley and roasted cashews.
