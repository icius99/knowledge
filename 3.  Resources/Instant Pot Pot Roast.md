### Instructions

-   **Brown Chuck Roast:** Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More function. Wait until it says HOT (~8 mins).
    
    Pat dry the chuck roast steak with a paper towel, then generously season one side of the roast with kosher salt and ground black pepper. Drizzle the inner pot with 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil, and ensure to coat the oil over the whole bottom of the pot. Then, place the seasoned side of the roast in Instant Pot. Season the other side with more salt + black pepper.
    
    Let it brown for 10 minutes per side (don’t need to constantly flip the roast) to develop some awesome deep flavors. Set browned roast aside.
    
-   **Sauté Onion & Garlic:** Add in sliced onions and saute until softened. Add in a pinch of kosher salt and ground black pepper to season. Add in garlic and saute for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add in mushroom and saute for 2 mins. Then season with another pinch of kosher salt.
    
-   **Deglaze Instant Pot:** Pour in a dash of red wine or balsamic vinegar, then deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
    
-   **Pressure Cook Pot Roast:** Add 1 cup (250ml) of chicken stock, 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15 ml) fish sauce, 1 pinch of dried rosemary, 1 pinch of thyme, and 2 bay leaves in Instant Pot. Taste the seasoning and add more salt and pepper if desired.
    
    Place the chuck roast and all its meat juice in Instant Pot.
    
    With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 45 minutes + Full Natural Release (25 minutes). Open the lid carefully.
    
-   **Pressure Cook Vegetables:** Set aside the chuck roast, and cover it with aluminum foil. Let it rest as you pressure cook the vegetables.
    
    Submerge the quartered potatoes into the yummy gravy, then stack the chopped carrots on top of the potatoes. With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 4 minutes + Quick Release. Open the lid carefully.
    
-   **Make Gravy & Serve:** Taste the gravy again, then adjust the seasoning if necessary. Mix 1 ½ tbsp (12g) cornstarch with 2 tbsp (30ml) water, then mix it into the gravy one third at a time until desired thickness.
    
    Slice the roast against the grain. _High five your family._ Serve pot roast and potatoes with the gravy. Immediately enjoy this umami filled dish you've just created!
