* Focus is sharp throughout,  given the size of these plants I would guess it's a macro lens or short telephoto.  Probably also focus stacking.
* Confirmed in PS that there is pure black in this image,  however there is no pure white.
* It is unlikely that the light was specifically highlighting this center section of plants.  It appears dodging was used in the middle.  It could also have been straight vignetting, but it doesn't seem uniform enough for that.
* Compositionally it looks like she selected three plants as the focus of the image,  no other plants in the image have such an obvious center and are fully contained within the frame.  She also made these three the brightest*
* The two smaller plants seem to occupy two of the main intersections of the rule of thirds.  Not sure what the larger one represents compositionally other than a repeating pattern?*
* Other than color adjustment like saturation/curves, which is impossible to confirm in the final image,  no other editing is obvious to me.

* Focus is sharp throughout,  I don't know the size of these plants, but I would guess it's a macro lens or short telephoto.  Probably also focus stacking.
* The strength of this composition lies in the uniform directionality of the plants.  It almost suggests motion.   There are also two plant tips in particular that occupy a major RoT intersection*
* There seems to be vignetting, but it is very subtle.  In addition to the vignetting, it looks like she tried to frame the composition with cooler colored sections of plants to add more emphasis to the warmer center.  Looks like maybe there was some desaturation as part of the vignetting as well? The ratio of the image is 3:2 so it looks to be the full frame,  I don't think it was cropped.
* Other than that it's a beautiful combination of striking complimentary colors.
