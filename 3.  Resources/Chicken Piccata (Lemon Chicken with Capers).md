**Recipe video above.** If, like me, you find the sauce of other Chicken Piccata recipes too sour, and the chicken kind of bland, I think you'll love this version! The lemon tang in the sauce is pleasant rather than lip-puckering, and the flavour of the chicken is boosted with a little parmesan in the flour coating.

### Ingredients

- 450g / 16oz chicken breast (2 large pieces), skinless boneless (Note 1)
- 4 tbsp flour (sub cornflour/cornstarch for GF)
- 2 1/2 tbsp parmesan , finely grated (Note 2)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp / 15g unsalted butter

#### Lemon Sauce:

- 2 tbsp / 30g unsalted butter , cut into 1.5cm / 1/2" cubes
- 2/3 cup dry white wine (Note 3)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice , fresh
- 3 tbsp capers in brine , drained (Note 4)
- 1 1/2 tsp parsley , finely chopped, plus more for garnish

### Instructions

#### Crispy Parmesan Chicken:

- Cut each breast into 3 pieces. Then place between 2 pieces of cling wrap or paper and pound to 1/2 cm / 0.2" thickness.
    
- Drizzle chicken with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and spread with your fingers on both sides.
    
- Mix flour, parmesan, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Coat chicken, pressing to adhere, then shaking off excess.
    
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Then add butter and let it melt.
    
- Place 3 pieces of chicken in the skillet. Cook 3 - 4 minutes until golden, then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove onto plate, repeat with remaining chicken.
    

#### Chicken Piccata Sauce:

- Pour out and discard excess fat in skillet, then give it a quick wipe with paper towels (no need to clean thoroughly).
    
- Still on medium high heat, add wine. Let it simmer rapidly until it reduces by half - around 3 minutes.
    
- Add lemon and simmer 1 minute.
    
- Reduce heat to low. Add cubed butter and swirl pan to make it melt but not go foamy. Sauce should be glossy, translucent and slightly thickened.
    
- Stir in capers and parsley. Serve chicken with Sauce, sprinkled with extra parsley if desired!
    

### Notes

**Servings -** If you use 2 large breasts (450g/16oz), you will serve 3 comfortable. If you use 2 smaller ones, this will serve 2 people.

**1. Chicken -** can also use tenderloin (no need to cut) or thighs (skinless, boneless, cut in half then pound).

**2. Parmesan** - or use store bought sandy type grated parmesan.

**3. Wine** - Any white wine that's not too woody or sweet will work great here. Chardonnay in particular adds really good flavour. Sub low sodium chicken stock/broth for a non alcoholic version.

**Don’t use an expensive wine.** The flavour and aroma that you pay for is largely lost during cooking. It’s pretty well documented these days by notable food authorities (such as New York Times Cooking) that you do not need to use expensive wines for cooking.

**4. Capers** - best to use capers in brine, rather than the dry capers in salt (bit too salty for this dish).

**5. Nutrition** - assumes 2 tbsp fat is discarded after cooking chicken and 1.5 tbsp flour / parmesan is discarded after coating.
