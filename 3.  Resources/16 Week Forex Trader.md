# Week 5

## Strategy

Find something simple that fits the information gathered in the previous weeks.

## My Routine

5:00 pm - Finish Work, have dinner,  relax
7:00 pm - Sit down at desk and open Tradingview
7:00 pm - 7:30 pm  Check my three timeframe charts on my pairs,  see if there are any opening likely to appear
Draw any support, resistance or trend lines
7:30 - 11:30 pm - Trading
11:30 pm - Close all open trades!
11:30 pm - Midnight: Write down any thoughts,  recaps from session

Need a very detailed plan on:

1. How will I identify a trade.
2. How will I execute the trade
3. What will I do once I'm in the trade
4. How will I exit the trade
5. What will I do after exiting the trade


# Week 6

## Mastering the Strategy

Write out your strategy steps 10 times on paper.  Fine someone who is somewhat familiar with trading and ask them if the steps are clear and easy to follow.


# Week 7

Backtest your strategy to 50 - 100 winners AND losers.  Document every trade. 

Rank your winners from best to worst.

Look for patterns in the winners and adjust your strategy accordingly.
