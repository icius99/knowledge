Always cut directly in the center where you balanced your handpiece.  Don't sweep side to side like on a mast machine!

Polishing problems can be solved by one of the following:

1. Lap Speed
2. Move to a different part of the lap (even off center)
3. Hand Pressure
4. Take off some diamond
5. Add more diamond
6. Vigorous Movement
7. A different lap (last resort)

When holding the handpiece,  pinch the front foot and touch the back feet to the plate first.  Then use those two front fingers to slowly let the front foot down.

Double check the polish on all facets before removing it from the machine

Double check your index number before you touch that stone to the lap!
