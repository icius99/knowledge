Smart Setup

Reference Bone Adjustment

Check placement of elbow and hand/finger bones.  Make sure to keep a slight bend in the elbow.

Three foot bones in the back should be moved to frame the edge of the foot.

The layer indicated is the Deform bones layer

Maybe don't use Preserve Volume during Binding

For Binding,  heatmaps should be used on hands and face.  Voxelized on everything else.

You can disable shapes when adjusting weights to see all bones as actual bones and not some of them as shapes
