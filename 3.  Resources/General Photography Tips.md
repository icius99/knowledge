**7 SIMPLE photography TIPS I wish I knew EARLIER**

https://youtu.be/jAk_xhs0Rcw

1. Use Aperture priority mode.   Don't futz around in full manual and miss the shot.  Use AP, metering and exposure compensation.  
2.  Push the shot to the right side of the histogram as much as you can.  Trying to pull detail out of shadows later will introduce a lot of noise in those areas.
3.  Focus.  Don't try and hone in on a perfect hyperfocal distance.  Focus on the far subject and don't include things closer than the minimum.  Unless of course you are doing focus stacking.
4.  Simplify your compositions.  Don't try to include everything.
5.  Use different lenses.  Focus on getting good lenses and not on changing the body all the time. 
6.  Think about where you are standing.  Don't be afraid to move to get a better shot. 
7.  Light, Light, Light!  Understand when the good light is.  Go at the right time of day.


**4 CAMERA settings that EVERY photographer MUST understand**

1. What ISO should you use?  What levels can your camera go to and still have quality? You can't just always use the lowest ISO.  
2. How small can your lens aperture go before you get diffraction and soft images.  This is different for every lens/camera combination.
3. Where do you focus? If you focus on the mountains how close in the foreground will things still be in focus?  This is different per lens.
4. How slow a shutter speed can you hand hold?

**7 BEGINNER PHOTOGRAPHY mistakes to AVOID**

1.  Not caring about distractions.  FIXES: Taking the sky out of forest photos.  Minding your corners and edges for distracting elements. 
2.  Caring about gear too much.  FIXES:  Focus on composition and getting the shot.  Not on every little nuance in your gear.
3.  Ignoring light. FIXES: Using sun and shade contrasts.  
4.  Using weather as a reason not to go shoot.   FIXES:  There are virtual no conditions that you can't get a great shot in.  Overcast is great for waterfalls and portraits. Rain saturates colors and makes things more reflective.  Blue sky can be boring but there are still opportunities for light and shade shots.
5.  Not being able to see the woods for the trees.  FIXES: You have to spend time at a location to appreciate it and get different shots.
6.  Blaming your camera.  FIXES:  You need to understand your camera and its settings as well as your position and composition.
7.  Not spending enough time editing.  FIXES:  Knowing what you can do in Lightroom will inform how you can set up a shot.  If you can plan to say "darken that corner there" then you can plan more.
