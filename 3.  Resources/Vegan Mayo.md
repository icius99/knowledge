### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups [raw cashews](https://amzn.to/2xNP7sg)
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice | about 1 large lemon juiced
- 1 tablespoon [apple cider vinegar](https://amzn.to/2LsempH)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup water

### Instructions

- Soak the raw cashew pieces in hot water for 5-10 minutes. I heat up water in my electric kettle and pour it over the cashews to soak.
    
- Drain the cashews, discard the water and add them to a [high powered blender](https://amzn.to/2J1iYoh). Now add the lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt and 3/4 cup fresh water. Blend until very smooth.
    
- Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It will thicken as it cools, making it better for spreading on sandwiches.Â 
    

### Notes

1. If you are allergic to cashews, I would suggest using this recipe for [Tofu Mayo](https://www.noracooks.com/tofu-vegan-mayonnaise-recipe/) instead.
