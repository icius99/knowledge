Alt + S - scale a handle and therefore the mesh around it
Ctrl + T - twist a handle
Alt + T - reset twist
RMB > Subdivide - add more handles to create sharper curvature
RMB > Smooth - smooth the handles out, useful when you have chaotically extruded
in general: use the cursor and rotate by cursor (press Dot > 3D Cursor) to create larger rotations in the curve to make things like braids easier. As an example: You just go to side view, move the points out from the center where your cursor was placed then select either start or end and with proportional editing rotate from cursor.
use Bevel Object to make more complex shapes, you can even add creases and duplicate the Bevel Object in edit mode to make the hair seem more complex.
also always watch your resolution both from the Bevel Object and the driving curve (The Resolution Preview). It can help to turn on Display Wire or Wireframe view
Try out what curve object you prefer, I like NurbsPath more as it gives me clear control points, other people like the BezierCurve more
with the Bezier Curve you can scale the handles to let them have stronger influence over the curve
