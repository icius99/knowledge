### CMF Cross

#### Chart Setup
##### Timeframe(s)
30 min
15 min
5 min

##### Indicators
100 period Simple Moving Average
Chaikin Money Flow (20)

##### Setup Conditions
There must be a clear trend on all three timeframes.
The price action must be fully above or fully below the 100 SMA on all three
If the 5 min price action breaks the 100 SMA the deal is off

##### Entry Conditions
Wait for a confirmed cross of the Chaikin zero line as well as a confirmed candle in the same direction.
Enter trade with appropriate stop loss and take profit.

If there is a confirmed cross of the Chaikin zero line in the wrong direction,  exit the trade!

##### Ideas

Maybe some indicator that the move has stalled and it's time to cash in?
Some way to let winners run?
