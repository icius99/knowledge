### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup [raw cashews*](https://amzn.to/2xNP7sg)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes plus more if desired
- 7-8 fresh basil leaves
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups water + more as needed
- (2) 15-ounce cans butter beans drained and rinsed
- 2 cups baby spinach sliced
- crusty bread for serving, optional

### Instructions

- **Soak the cashews:** Bring 2-3 cups of water to a boil (I use my tea kettle). Pour the hot water over the cashews and let soak for 5 minutes or up to an hour.
    
- **Blend the sauce:** Drain the cashews and add to a high powered blender, along with the garlic, sun dried tomatoes, basil leaves, lemon juice, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt and water. Blend until creamy and smooth.
    
- **Cook sauce and beans:** Pour the creamy sauce into a large skillet. Add the drained and rinsed beans and simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring often. Add a little more water, if desired, for a thinner sauce.
    
- **Stir in spinach and finish:** Stir in the spinach and more sun dried tomatoes, if desired. Cook until the spinach wilts and is bright green. Remove from heat and taste, adding salt or black pepper as needed. Serve with crusty bread.
    

### Notes

1. You can substitute sunflower seeds or raw slivered almonds for the cashews, if needed. Or use a can of full fat coconut milk and omit the water (or use more as needed to thin the sauce).
2. If you can't find butter beans, this recipe works well with any kind of white beans - great northern, navy or chickpeas.
3. I love to serve it with crusty bread for dipping, but it's good over rice, quinoa or another grain as well.
4. This is a great meal prep recipe! Store the leftovers in covered containers for up to 4 days. Reheat and serve.
