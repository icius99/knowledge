## Ingredients

Ingredient Checklist

-    8 ounces whole-wheat spaghettini 
-    3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
-    1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces 
-    1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning 
-    2 pints multicolored cherry tomatoes 
-    3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
-    1 teaspoon salt 
-    ¼ teaspoon ground pepper 
-    ¼ cup dry white wine 
-    1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic glaze (see Tip) 
-    1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated on smallest holes of box grater (about 1/4 cup) 
-    ¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-    Step 1 
    
   Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt. Drain and set aside.
    
-    Step 2 
    
   Meanwhile, heat oil in a large high-sided skillet over high heat. Add chicken and Italian seasoning; cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. (Do not wipe the pan clean.)
    
-    Step 3 
    
   Reduce heat to medium-low. Add tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper; cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits, until the tomatoes begin to burst, 4 to 5 minutes. Add wine; increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes, pressing on the tomatoes as needed to crush them. Add the pasta and chicken; toss gently to combine. Divide the pasta mixture among 4 bowls. Drizzle evenly with balsamic glaze; sprinkle with Parmesan and basil.
    

## Tips

Tip: Balsamic glaze is balsamic vinegar that's cooked until it's very thick. Look for it with other vinegars in well-stocked supermarkets.
