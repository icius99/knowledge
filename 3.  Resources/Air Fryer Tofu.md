### Ingredients

- 14 ounce block extra-firm or firm tofu
- 2 tablespoons [low sodium soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2EPiAGY) or tamari for gluten free
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon [sesame oil](https://amzn.to/2mvSBu8)
- 1 tablespoon [cornstarch](https://amzn.to/2Bio0Ij)

### Instructions

- **Quick press the tofu:** Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes. _Or use a tofu press._
    
- Add the pressed tofu cubes to a bowl and drizzle the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil over them. Toss gently to coat the pieces, then sprinkle on the cornstarch and gently toss to coat. Let the tofu marinate for about 15 minutes, or longer if desired (overnight is fine).
    
- Place the tofu cubes in the air fryer, in a single layer, so the pieces don't touch. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook half the tofu at a time. Air fry at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally after 10 minutes. Cook until the tofu is golden and crispy, but not burned. Serve and enjoy!
    

### Notes

1. **Gluten free?** Use tamari instead of soy sauce.
2. May use olive oil instead of sesame oil, but I love the flavor sesame oil adds. For oil free, you may omit it but it may not get as crispy.
3. If you have leftover tofu, simply re-heat in the air fryer for 5 minutes to re-crisp! It will keep for 3-4 days in the refrigerator.

## Ingredients needed (with substitutions)

- **Extra firm tofu** – Only extra firm or firm tofu will work for this recipe. Make sure you take the time to press all of the excess moisture out first or else the cubes won’t be as crispy. You can do this on the weekend to make for quick weeknight meals!
- **Cornstarch** – This is where air fryer tofu gets its crunch. When cooked, cornstarch sticks to the outside of the tofu cubes and forms an ultra-crisp and light coating. Arrowroot starch can be used as a substitute.
- **Soy sauce** – Or tamari for gluten free.
- **Rice vinegar**
- **Sesame oil** – You can use olive oil or vegetable oil if you don’t have sesame oil, but the tofu will be missing a delicious nutty, umami-like flavor.

The tofu marinade is fun to play with, so don’t feel like you have to only use soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Mix it up by stirring in maple syrup, sriracha or your favorite hot sauce, fresh garlic, dried herbs, and any other condiments or seasonings you love.

## How to make air fryer tofu

_Find the instructions with measurements, temperatures, and bake times on the recipe card below._

Make sure you press all of the excess moisture out of the brick of tofu before getting started. You can do this with a [tofu press](https://amzn.to/3bcKAGW) or by covering the tofu cubes with a clean towel and placing something heavy on top. Let the water drain out for about 15 minutes.

Once that’s done, transfer the tofu cubes to a large bowl. Drizzle the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil over the tofu.

Next, sprinkle the cornstarch over the tofu. Stir to coat.

Place the tofu in a single layer in the air fryer. If the cubes are too crowded or piled on top of each other, they won’t get crispy. Work in batches if necessary.

Air fry for 10 to 15 minutes on high heat, shaking the basket after about 10 minutes. The tofu is ready to eat once it’s golden and crispy!

## Serving suggestions

The great thing about air fryer tofu is how flexible it is. Simply enjoy it as-is on a loaded [green salad](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-caesar-salad/), [meal prep bowls](https://www.noracooks.com/nourish-bowl-vegan-meal-prep/), or [vegan stir fry](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-stir-fry/). It can give all kinds of meals a flavorful crunch and extra protein all in one.

When you want to take it up a notch, toss the crispy tofu in [bang bang sauce](https://www.noracooks.com/cauliflower-steaks/), [orange sauce](https://www.noracooks.com/crispy-baked-orange-tofu/), [peanut sauce](https://www.noracooks.com/quick-easy-asian-peanut-sauce/), or [barbecue sauce](https://www.noracooks.com/quick-and-easy-vegan-barbecue-sauce/). Now that it’s saucy and extra delicious, it would be a fantastic addition to vegetable wraps or [teriyaki noodles](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-teriyaki-noodle-bowls/). The possibilities are endless!

## Storing crispy tofu

The cooked tofu cubes can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. To retain its crispiness later on, reheat the tofu in the air fryer at 375ºF for about 3 to 5 minutes.

**Pro tip**: Save a little time and leave the uncooked cubes in the soy sauce marinade for up to 1 day in advance. Afterward, toss in cornstarch and air fry!
