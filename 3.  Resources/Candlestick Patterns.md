## Most Reliable Candlestick Patterns with Strategies

Before you start investing your hard-earned money in candlestick patterns, let’s set some expectations straight. While these candle formations can help analyze the markets and make informed trading decisions, it’s crucial to remember that **they’re not a one-way ticket to easy profits**. As Edwin Lefèvre wisely noted in ‘Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,’ _‘Easy profits in the stock market are the bait on the hook that catches the mug.’_ This reminder serves as a caution against the allure of quick gains and underscores the importance of thorough analysis and strategy in trading.

In addition to explaining each pattern, we have developed comprehensive live trading strategies for every single one. For an in-depth exploration, simply click on the links within each pattern’s description. These will guide you to detailed strategies for various scenarios, complete with predefined approaches and integration with other key indicators.

### Hammer and Inverted Hammer

![Hammer and Inverted Hammer Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-hammer-inverted.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

A [hammer candlestick pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/hammer-and-inverted-hammer-patterns/) is a bullish reversal pattern that is most accurate at the bottom of a downtrend. It signals that sellers are losing power and are being outnumbered by buyers. Traders look for the hammer pattern as a signal to buy, as it suggests that the price will likely rise in the near future.

The candlestick has a small body, a long lower shadow, and no upper shadow. Also, the lower shadow has to be longer in height than the candlestick’s body for the pattern to be valid. The color of the body of a hammer candlestick can be either green or red.

The inverted hammer pattern looks the same as the hammer pattern. The only difference is that it’s upside down. Despite being called “inverted,” it’s still a bullish reversal pattern. It indicates the end of a downtrend and a possible trend reversal to the upside.

### Pin Bar

![Bullish and Bearish Pin Bar Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pinbars.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [pin bar candlestick pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/bullish-and-bearish-pin-bar-patterns) is undoubtedly the most traded pattern out there, and it is for a good reason. This pattern is used by traders to identify possible trend reversals or continuations after a pullback. Its accuracy is significantly higher when it forms around key support and resistance levels, trendlines, and moving averages.

The bullish pin bar is characterized by a long lower shadow, with a small body and a relatively short shadow on the other end. The tail of the pin bar (the lower shadow) has to be at least two-thirds of the entire length of the candlestick for the pattern to be valid.

The bearish pin bar is the opposite of the bullish pin bar. It has a long upper shadow, a small body, and a short lower shadow. This rejection of higher prices signals that the market may be losing momentum and that a bearish reversal may come soon. Once a bearish pin bar is confirmed, traders look for short selling opportunities.

### Engulfing

![Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/engulfing-crt.jpg?resize=1022%2C456&ssl=1)

The [engulfing candlestick pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/bullish-and-bearish-engulfing-patterns/) is one of the most common patterns used by traders to identify trend reversals and continuations after a pullback in the financial markets.

In a bullish engulfing pattern, the first candlestick is red, and the second one is green. The body of the green candlestick is much larger than the body of the red candlestick, with very little to no overlapping shadows. Also, the green candlestick has to open lower than the previous candlestick’s close and close higher than the previous candlestick’s high. The bullish engulfing pattern indicates that buyers have taken control, and the price will likely go up.

A bearish engulfing pattern is valid when a green candlestick is followed by a larger red candlestick. The exact opposite of a bullish engulfing pattern. The green candlestick must completely cover (or engulf) the previous candlestick. The pattern suggests that the bears have taken charge of the market and indicate a possible decline in price in the near future, so traders look for shorting opportunities.

### The Morning Star

![Morning Star Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-mornings.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [morning star pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/morning-and-evening-star-patterns/) essentially implies the bullish state of the market, as the appearance of the morning star is just before sunrise. It is more accurate when it forms at the end of a downtrend. The morning star is a three-candlestick pattern:

The first candlestick is a bearish candlestick with relatively small shadows.

The second candlestick has a small green or red body and short shadows. This candlestick forms at the lower end of the first candlestick.

The third candlestick is a bullish candlestick that indicates strong buying pressure and a potential trend reversal. The body of this candlestick has to be at least the same size as the first candlestick or bigger.

Traders look for the morning star pattern as a signal to buy, as it suggests that the price will likely rise soon.

### The Evening Star

![Evening Star Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-evenings.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The evening star pattern is the upside-down version of the morning star pattern. It indicates the reversal of an uptrend into a downtrend. The three candlesticks are characterized as follow:

The first candlestick is a bullish candlestick with relatively small shadows.

The second candlestick has a small green or red body and short shadows.

The third candlestick is a bearish candle, and the body is bigger than the first one (or at least the same size).

### Three White Soldiers

![Three White Soldiers Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-threewhites.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [three white soldiers pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/three-white-soldiers-pattern/) is a bullish reversal pattern consisting of three green candlesticks with small shadows. This pattern is more reliable when it forms in a downtrend that has been developing for a longer period of time.

For this pattern to be valid, each candlestick has to open near the previous candlestick’s close price.

Traders and analysts often interpret this pattern as a signal to enter long positions or add to existing ones, expecting further price gains.

### Three Black Crows

![Three Black Crows Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-threeblacks.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [three black crows pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/three-black-crows-pattern/) is a bearish reversal pattern that is more accurate when it forms at the end of an uptrend. Think of it as an upside down three white soldiers pattern.

This pattern is formed by three consecutive bearish candlesticks. The opening of each candlestick occurs at the previous candlestick’s closing price, and the closing price is lower than the opening price. The three black crows pattern is particularly significant when it occurs at higher price levels or after a mature advance, indicating a potential decline in prices.

### Dark Cloud Cover

![Dark Cloud Cover Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-darkclouds.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [dark cloud cover](https://www.morpher.com/blog/dark-cloud-cover-pattern/) “phenomenon” signals the potential end of an uptrend. It is a two-candle pattern where the first candle is a long green candlestick, followed by a long red candlestick that opens above the previous candlestick’s close. During its trading period, the price starts to decline significantly and the red candlestick closes below the midpoint of the first candlestick’s body.

This pattern suggests that the sunny days of the current uptrend are coming to an end. Bulls are losing control, and the bears are taking over.

### Hanging Man

![Hanging Man Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-hanging.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [hanging man pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/hanging-man-pattern/) is a bearish signal. The shape of the Hanging Man candlestick resembles a person hanging by their feet, hence the name. It typically occurs after an uptrend in the market and suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening or reversing. The hanging man candlestick has a small body positioned at the top of the candle and a long lower shadow. The lower shadow must be at least twice as long as the candle’s body, and there must be a small or no upper shadow.

### Doji

![Doji Pattern](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/img_pattern-doji-classic.png?resize=480%2C480&ssl=1)

The term “doji” in Japanese translates to “the same thing,” and it refers to the candlesticks with the open and close prices more or less the same. The length of the upper and lower shadows can vary.

A classic doji pattern is a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision and uncertainty in the market. The pattern indicates that neither the buyers nor sellers are in control and that the market is in a state of equilibrium. Traders interpret the presence of a doji pattern as a signal to exercise caution and await further confirmation or additional information before making any decisive buying or selling decisions.

There are different types of doji patterns, including the classic doji (which was described above), gravestone doji, and dragonfly doji. Each type of doji pattern has its own unique characteristics and interpretation.

![Gravestone and Dragonfly Doji Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-doji2.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

Gravestone doji and dragonfly doji are very similar to the bearish and bullish pin bar patterns except for the size of the body. A doji candlestick has no body, meaning that the opening and closing prices are virtually the same, while a pin bar possesses a small body. In general, **pin bars are more reliable than gravestone or dragonfly doji candlesticks.**

### Harami

![Bullish and Bearish Harami Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-haramis.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The word “Harami” in Japanese means “pregnant.” The term represents the pattern’s appearance, which resembles a pregnant woman’s body with a small candlestick “inside it.” Don’t judge. I didn’t come up with this name.

The [harami pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/bullish-and-bearish-harami-patterns/) is formed by two consecutive candlesticks. The first candlestick has a long body and small shadows. The second candlestick is a small candle with a body that is entirely inside the previous candlestick’s body.

In an uptrend, the harami pattern will have the first candlestick green and the second candlestick red. This indicates a possible trend reversal.

Likewise, in a downtrend the first candlestick is red, and the second one is green—a good time to look for buying opportunities.

### Marubozu

![Bullish and Bearish Marubozu Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-marubozu2.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The term marubozu means “bald head” or “shaved head” in Japanese. The [Marubozu pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/bullish-and-bearish-marubozu-patterns/) is a candlestick with a long body with no shadows. It can either be bullish or bearish depending on its color and is the most accurate in trend continuations after pullbacks.

A bullish marubozu is a long green candlestick with no upper or lower shadow. This candlestick indicates that buyers controlled the market price from the open to the close, suggesting a strong bullish sentiment.

A bearish Marubozu is the opposite of a bullish Marubozu. The candlestick has a long red body with no upper or lower shadow, indicating that the price opened at its high and closed at its low. This suggests that the bears were in complete control of the market and that selling pressure remained strong throughout the session.

### Tweezer Top and Bottom

![Tweezer Top and Bottom Patterns](https://i0.wp.com/morpherhome.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/img_pattern-tweezers.png?resize=1076%2C480&ssl=1)

The [tweezer pattern](https://www.morpher.com/blog/tweezer-top-and-bottom-patterns/) is a short-term reversal pattern and it forms when two candlestick bodies have the same highs (in an uptrend) or lows (in a downtrend). This pattern indicates a struggle between buyers and sellers and can signal a potential trend reversal.

In a downtrend, the pattern is called **tweezer bottom**, and requires two consecutive candlestick bodies of either color to reach the same low point. This formation indicates that buyers are entering the market, as they were able to push the price back up from the low reached by the first candlestick.

When the market is in an uptrend, traders refer to the pattern as a **tweezer top** and it requires two consecutive candlesticks to have the same highs to be considered valid. This pattern signals a shift in market momentum and a potential trend reversal as bears begin to take control of the market.
