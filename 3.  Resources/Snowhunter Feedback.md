## Texturing

1 - I really like the model, it is cute and I like the softness of the texture. But why is there no underwear?
2 - Back texture could use indication of shoulder blades and spine.
3 - Dress and hoodie, you could be more aggressive with lights and shadows, also missing hearts on hoodie.
4 - Could be cute to make the split on the back of the hoodie go all the way up to the tail, or make an indication of a hole in the hoodie for the tail.
5 - Strange texture shadow around the hip?

## Mesh

1 - Mesh flow is okay, you got some strange spots on the model that I don't understand why you made it that way 
2 - Like around the ankles
3 - And the feet, probably for optimisation, but it feels more like they were made for a different model.
4 - The butt is really in there, maybe don't take the mesh, that far in
5 - Why is there just a massive plane on the boobs? Should be collapsed
6 - Ears could be optimised instead of being collapsed in the middle.
7 - There is no need for the mesh to close the neck hole, it will never been seen as it is inside the head
8 - Belly button has a lot of mesh compared to the rest of the model (you don't need it to go that far in)
9 - There is a strange twist in the arm mesh flow, should keep it more straight, unless you are doing something with muscle flow
10 - I do really like your hands, very nice mesh flow!
11 - Try not to use triangles around areas that have a lot of movement, like around the butt. You can move it down the leg if you are trying to optimise the model.
12 - I do like the head shape you have made, maybe the eyes are a bit too far back on the sides
13 - There is a lot of mesh on the tip of the nose maybe that can be optimised and still keep the shape
14 - A lot of mesh in the back of the mouth, can be optimized

## Blend Shapes

1 - Looking good! 
2 - Eyes blink got a weird vertex running away
3 - Tongue is not touching the teeth, makes it look strange in the mouth
4 - Really like how much the jaw is moving with the mouth movement

## Model

1 - Really don't like how the hair is clipping into the body, I know it is difficult to get the right shape when making 2d into 3d, but it is a shame that it is cliping in the t pose and even with the arms down.
2 - The ears are also clipping with the hair
3 - Really like how you made the back of the hair look and mesh flow
4 - Can see you have multiple concept arts, but the eyebrows are different on the one in use, is it on purpose?
5 - Hair close to the shrimp, could use a helping edge to make the shape not collapse
6 - The leg warmers are super cute, but I feel you could have made the shape more aggressive
7 - Shoes perfect 10/10
8 - The skirt feels loose on the body, would help if the frills pokes out
9 - The hood on the hoodie is clipping with the shoulder, would raise the hood mesh
10 - The hoodie is clipping with the dress maybe make the hoodie a bit bigger
11 - Hair is also clipping with the hoodie
12 - Missing hair clips beside the star in the hair

## Rigging

1 - Overall fine
2 - Clavicle is sitting very far away from its rotation point
3 - When skinning do you use auto normalize? You have some strange collapses happening.
4 - Boobs should be moving with the chest not the spine
5 - Twist bones in the arms would be a good thing to have for VRChat
6 - Eye bone makes the eye pop out and highlight is not following. There seems to be double eyebones???
7 - A lot of your skinning is bleeding/very smooth. That makes the bones rotate mesh it should not. Like the boobs, why do they have control of the entire ribcage, most of that skinning should be to the chest bone
8 - The face has a hold on the shoulder
9 - The top of the neck should be fully skinned to the head
10 - A lot of bones have skinning on the hoodie that should not be there.
11 - Some clipping on the dress, around chest and hip
12 - Drawstrings are not following the hood when the boobs move

It is good to follow the reference/concept art. However the most important thing to do is to remember that you are making a 3D model not a 2D, so it have to look good in 3D from all angles. And if that means it is not a 1 to 1, that is okay.

I have only been in the blender file but have seen the dance video. I hope that the feedback will help to some degree. It is a really nice model you have made and the movement looks nice in the video. Keep up the good work!
