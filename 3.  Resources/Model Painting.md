# Airbrushing

## Acrylic Cleaning Recipe

90% Airbrush Thinner
10% Flow Aid

## Acrylic Priming

Even if the primer is "airbrush ready" still put a few drops of the "Acrylic Cleaning Recipe" in first.

After putting the paint in,  do the blowback procedure for a few seconds.

## Acrylic Cleaning

1. Add water to cup and do blowback procedure.
2. Dump out water and wipe the inside of the cup
3. Do this over and over until the water is clean (2 or 3 times)
4. If it still isn't clean,  remove the needle and wipe it down.
5. Put a few drops of isopropyl in the cup and scrub around with an old brush.
6. Do the blowback procedure again.
7. Dump that out and put clean water in.  Make sure it sprays clean.

## Acrylic Base Coating

Paint should be thinner for base coating than priming.

Add some water along with the paint.  Should be the consistency of skim milk.
