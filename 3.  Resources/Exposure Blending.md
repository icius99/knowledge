1. Choose your "base" exposure,  the one that you are happy with most of the scene having.
2. Choose an exposure where the highlights are not blown out.
3. Choose an exposure where all of the shadow detail is visible.

If you are masking to bring in elements from the dark exposure.  Have only the base exposure visible when you create the masks.

If you are masking to bring in elements from the light exposure.  Have only the light exposure visible when you create the mask.  Also invert the mask. 

You can adjust levels on a mask with Ctrl-L

To create a luminosity mask.  Make sure the layer from which you want the mask created is visible.  Then select the layer that you want the mask created on.
Then go to Image-->Apply Image...

When doing exposure blending with a brush.  Make sure Flow is set at 100%!!

You can use the luminosity mask as a selection.  Then hide the marching ants and you can paint on a black mask to essentially Paint with the Luminosity Mask!

When exposure blending you can run into stuff like this:

The exposure showing the outside detail was way darker than the inside of the house.

To fix this,  you need to increase the exposure of the dark image while reducing the highlights.  You are trying to get the dark exposure close to the exposure of the base image without blowing out the highlights.

To make it look even more natural,  bring down the highlights in the base exposure as well.    The result is:

Now the exposure blending result looks much better:

However,  in this scene the eye expects the outsid to be really bright.  So it is a good idea to bring back just a bit of the brightness of the outside with levels and a clipping mask:
