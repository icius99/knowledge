Check all along the csx railroad easts side of cleveland on cutouts that you can get to. There's supposedly diamond occurrences in Big Creek east of the zoo in Cleveland and pyrite down by Parma heights. Pyrite in Euclid Creek, Pyrite in Tinkers creek in bedford, a tributary into west creek and west creek in Brooklyn heights has minerals, deerlick cave in brecksville, Abrams creek in brook park has pickeringite. Big theme here. Check your rivers, where it's not Uber populated, for outcrops and such.
