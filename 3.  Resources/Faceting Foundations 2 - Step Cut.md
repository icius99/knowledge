## Preforming

Justin used a 360 topper lap on his Sterling at 836 RPM.

### Before:

### In Process:

![[Pasted image 20241213213555.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213213654.png]] ![[Pasted image 20241213213712.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213213755.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213214113.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241213214246.png]] This has to be removed from the culet or it will reflect all through the stone.

## Dopping

![[Pasted image 20241213215120.png]]

## Cutting the Crown

He starts this stage with an 800 grit lap.

First start with the girdle outline.  This is Justin's result after going around once.  No mention yet of how to make sure each side is exactly equal:

![[Pasted image 20241213220129.png]]


Interestingly he is using the loupe already on this stage

After another round:

![[Pasted image 20241213220357.png]]


Ok, he is using his fingers on the front foot to feel whether or not it is touching the glass.  That is how he knows when to stop depth!!  As soon as the front foot is resting on the glass he stops.


After round 3

![[Pasted image 20241213220643.png]]  ![[Pasted image 20241213220657.png]] ![[Pasted image 20241213220714.png]]

 There's a big inclusion on the corner which may break off:
 
 ![[Pasted image 20241213220937.png]]

Just using the front foot method and the 800 grit lap he is done with the girdle for now.


Next he does the table just to flatten it.  

![[Pasted image 20241213221202.png]]

This chip dictates that the first tier must be cut below it:
![[Pasted image 20241213221524.png]]



![[Pasted image 20241213221452.png]]


He used the same "feeling the foot hit the plate" method to cut the rest of tier 1

He runs his lap pretty dry:
![[Pasted image 20241213221705.png]]

This C1 after that round:
![[Pasted image 20241213221752.png]]


Not all the corners are met yet

This is what the table ended up looking like at that point:

![[Pasted image 20241213221856.png]]

Now he switches to a 1200 lap to balance out the main facets for C1

This is after one round of 1200

![[Pasted image 20241213222040.png]]

Now he goes around again with a loupe to match all the facets at the corners. 

![[Pasted image 20241213222217.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213222251.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213222305.png]]![[Pasted image 20241213222325.png]]

So then he went back to the table.  On 96 index.  

![[Pasted image 20241213222442.png]]

Now he cuts C2 using the table as a reference line.

These are so small he's cutting them in on the 1200 lap

Once he cuts the first facet,  he doesn't touch the height adjustment to cut the other three.  Light touches and use the loupe to confirm!!

![[Pasted image 20241213222659.png]]


Using that method,  he got this result.  But he says "don't worry about it"

![[Pasted image 20241213222801.png]]

This will be fixed in the polish stage.

## Polishing the Crown

Wash your hands before starting to polish

Don't really need to clean the dual lap much.  Let it evolve over time.

Don't always jump into adjusting angles for polish right away.  Topper laps can leave things uneven,  so let the polishing lap do its job first.

Watch out for heat while polishing, feel the stone,  if it is getting hot,  dip it in some water to cool it off (specifically for oil/grease based polishing)

He's polishing at 937 RPM!

First pass on the first facet:

![[Pasted image 20241213224659.png]]

There were some surface level inclusions.  

He uses a pretty vigorous back and forth motion with the hand piece while polishing. 

Second main facet:

![[Pasted image 20241213224955.png]]


 Ok so,  in order to check his meets,  he ends up polishing part of the girdle.  And here are the interesting bits:
 
 * He does it at 89 degrees instead of 90 so he only polishes the top part closest to the crown.
 * His handpiece didn't go low enough so he put some washers under the lap to raise it.
 * He only did pre-polish since the handpiece wouldn't reach the inner ring of the dual lap
 * Be very careful with this step that you don't unbalance the first set of facets.



Here's the result:
![[Pasted image 20241213230623.png]]

So he had one corner that didn't quite meet,  the other three were fine.  He fixed that by giving that facet more time on the fine polish.   But he didn't use the cheater or anything.  Somehow it just fixed the unevenness?  Maybe more artifacts from the topper lap?

Starting on the table, this was the initial touch

![[Pasted image 20241213231105.png]]

Now this could be due to the flatness of the topper lap,  or could actually be the angle.  He gives it a few more seconds without changing angle to see if it flattens out.

And that's what happened,  it just needed to flatten out:
![[Pasted image 20241213231240.png]]


He had to float the front foot to get the table to reach the inner ring.

Watch out for heat when polishing the table!  

Streakiness normal from pre-polish:

![[Pasted image 20241213231701.png]]

 The final polish,  there was a surface reaching crack that couldn't be polished out:
 
 ![[Pasted image 20241213231843.png]]


After polishing all the C2s  This was the result:

![[Pasted image 20241213232729.png]]

Big mismatch in the corner!

So he did use the cheater,  only a half step and repolished the C2 facets,  only on the fine polish ring!

That yielded the following:

![[Pasted image 20241213233238.png]]

THE CHEATER ONLY AFFECTS THE BOTTOM LINE OF A FACET!!  TO ADJUST THE TOP LINE YOU HAVE TO GO UP A TIER!

In this case the table need to move this way:

![[Pasted image 20241213233351.png]]

Always polish the table from only one index!  In this case it was always 96.

To tilt the table he had to adjust the back foot since the cheater does nothing for the table.

Be very careful when doing this kind of thing with the table!

After first touch this is what he saw:

![[Pasted image 20241213233634.png]]

Look at the facets around the table,  not at the table to see if you are fixing it!

After fine adjustments of the front to back angle and left to right tilt he ended up with this:

![[Pasted image 20241213234136.png]]


What he then discovered is that the C2 and C1 facets were slightly skewed causing this effect.  

![[Pasted image 20241213234233.png]]


MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK TO ZERO AND THE CHEATER BACK TO ZERO BEFORE MOVING TO ANOTHER TIER!!

When doing these fine adjustments,  he is raising the table each time before touching down again.

He ended up cheating on just C2 on that side. 


## Transferring the stone

## Cutting the Pavilion

He started cutting with a 600 grit lap.

Once girdle starts to get thinner you can check the balance of the first tier with the girdle.

His first facet was a little fat on the left:

![[Pasted image 20241214220845.png]]

He used the cheater just a little bit (less than a whole number) to make it parallel

![[Pasted image 20241214220915.png]]

He took the facet down until the girdle was this thick:

![[Pasted image 20241214221017.png]]

He used a loupe, even on the 600 to balance the other 3 facets.

When he got to the final side there was a mismatch:

![[Pasted image 20241214221349.png]]

The first thing he checked was all the other meets to make sure they were dead on.  DON'T TOUCH THE CHEATER UNTIL YOU'VE CHECKED THIS!!

Just by checking the other meets and adjusting, he was able to fix it:

![[Pasted image 20241214221601.png]]

Now he switched to a 1200 lap

As he was thinning the girdle some more with the first facet,  he noticed that it didn't look quite parallel anymore.  He used the cheater to adjust a tiny bit to level it out again.

![[Pasted image 20241214221858.png]]

Fixed:

![[Pasted image 20241214221949.png]]

Final pass of P1 with 1200

![[Pasted image 20241214222053.png]]

  For a step cut,  P1 should be the biggest and then the rest should be getting smaller toward the culet.

This is where he started with P1

![[Pasted image 20241214222257.png]]

Here is the final first cut of all the tiers:

![[Pasted image 20241214222647.png]]

If the tiers start looking a little off parallel during cutting DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  That can all be taken care of during polishing.

## Polishing the Pavilion

Usually the pavilion needs more adjustment during polishing than the crown.

Do the first tiny touch on the 8k ring and check it.  Doesn't even have to polish,  just see where the grease is.  If it covers the entire facet then it may just be dead on:

![[Pasted image 20241214223649.png]]

Disaster struck while he was polishing the first facet.   The corner popped out!

![[Pasted image 20241214223831.png]]


He is going to finish polishing the pavilion and then decide what to do.

## Fixing the Corner

For emerald style cuts with cut corners the corner angles are usually 5-10 degrees deeper than the sides.

![[Pasted image 20241215100612.png]]![[Pasted image 20241215100634.png]]




## Using the Cheater

He recut part of the stone to demonstrate using the cheater

![[Pasted image 20241215100853.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241215100921.png]]

So the girdle and Tier 2 are not parallel.  

The fix for this is NOT recutting Tier 1!!  The cheater only affects the line below it.  Need to apply cheater to Tier 2

![[Pasted image 20241215101204.png]]

Moving the wheel counter clockwise involves tightening the cheater.

After the cheater adjustment,  this is what the facet started to look like:

![[Pasted image 20241215101358.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241215101509.png]]

This shows that the cheater wasn't turned enough because the line is still not parallel

This is the second attempt:

![[Pasted image 20241215101604.png]]![[Pasted image 20241215101618.png]]

Still not parallel

This is the third attempt

![[Pasted image 20241215101714.png]]![[Pasted image 20241215101744.png]]


Still just slightly crooked

Fourth attempt - fixed!

![[Pasted image 20241215101846.png]]

However,  now this facet is much bigger

![[Pasted image 20241215101938.png]]

The Tier 1 facet on the right is now too small compared to the recut one.  However,  you can't just cut it more at the same angle.  That will make the girdle smaller too.

Need to make the angle smaller 

He starts with 1/2 a degree smaller angle.  

BUUUUTTTT!  Need to get the cheater back to the second facet's rotation.  How to do this?  Turn off the machine and just barely touch the facet to the lap.  Notice where the grease is:

![[Pasted image 20241215102318.png]]

So the cheater is not yet aligned

After adjusting the cheater this is what it looks like:

![[Pasted image 20241215102418.png]]

This is the small touch

![[Pasted image 20241215102601.png]]

See the small facet starting to come in on top of Tier1

Need to try to get the top and bottom of the new facet to touch the top and bottom at the same time.  

![[Pasted image 20241215102659.png]]

This was coming in on the bottom a bit too fast,  so he went a half degree smaller

After that attempt he stopped at the girdle and this was the result:

![[Pasted image 20241215102824.png]]

So he went a whole degree smaller

This was the result,  he met the tier at the top.  HOWEVER.  Now there was  small secondary facet at the bottom that meant that the new cut didn't quite reach the girdle

![[Pasted image 20241215103018.png]]![[Pasted image 20241215103045.png]]

So he just lowered the plate a bit to adjust the angle and merge those things together.

![[Pasted image 20241215103244.png]]

So now there is one Tier 1 facet at 51 degrees and the rest are at 54.  But that's ok,  nobody will ever be able to tell.

## Fixing the Corner on the crown

![[Pasted image 20241215103453.png]]

Redopped (he didn't use a cone dop)

![[Pasted image 20241215103655.png]]

Realigning the table to the lap

Soften the wax a bit and touch the table to the un-running lap to flatten it.  Check it again to see if the grease is touching all the table at once.

![[Pasted image 20241215103845.png]]

Re-align the girdle to the 96 index tooth.

Going SUPER SLOW to make sure the new facet is coming in correctly.  Like 125 rpm

![[Pasted image 20241215104108.png]]

After adjusting the angle

![[Pasted image 20241215104203.png]]

Need to apply some cheater.  And lowered the angle to 50

![[Pasted image 20241215104243.png]]

More cheater and angle to 55

![[Pasted image 20241215104342.png]]

Because it's so big,  he's putting in a C2 facet

![[Pasted image 20241215104422.png]]

The result

![[Pasted image 20241215104840.png]]
