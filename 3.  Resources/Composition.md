##### How do you look for a composition?

1. Take your time,  don't rush.
2. Use your phone to look around with a frame and see if you can find anything interesting.
3. If you find something interesting, get your camera out and try some framing or test shots.
4. Don't set up your tripod and everything until you have found something.
5. Find a point of interest.  How will you attract your viewer's eye to that point?
6. Simplicity,  don't include too many elements.  No distracting elements in the corners.

##### Patterns in the Landscape

1. Look for repeating patterns.


#####  Look for lines and shapes that guide the viewer through the image

1. S-curves, diagonals, triangles

##### Moving from 3D to 2D

Trees in the background tend to become flat and busy.  Fog can help with this greatly.

##### Using negative space

##### Don't allow the viewer to leave the image distracted

![[Pasted image 20210821115651.png]]

This image is too distracting

![[Pasted image 20210821115709.png]]

The fog makes this much better.



##### Don't  be afraid to find a good shot within another one (cropping)

Rule of Thirds - put something interesting where they cross.  Can also be used for horizon/sky line placement

Leading Lines - use features of the scene to lead the line into the subject.  Just don't let the lines lead your eye out of the photo.

**The Plunge**

![[Pasted image 20210922213300.png]]

Compositions featuring this pattern will contain a prominent mass or collection of elements that attract the eye to the foreground and then plunge it into the background of a scene. The form that directs the eye may originate from any area near the bottom of the frame. If the shape of the pattern leads to a clear visual payoff in the background, then it will help to establish that background feature as the primary point of visual interest.

**The Echo**

![[Pasted image 20210922213341.png]]

When one prominent element in a scene repeats the forms of another, it creates a visual ‘echo’, as it were. The related elements strengthen each other by association, and if one of them is the primary feature of the scene or else leads to it, then the entire image is likely to have a strong sense of hierarchy and intention. Finding an ‘echo’ in a scene will usually give the viewer that ‘aha moment’ that can make viewing an image particularly exciting.

**The Layer Cake**

![[Pasted image 20210922213421.png]]

When overlapping layers have adequate separation, they can create an exciting sense of depth in a scene. Layers that share visual qualities will also provide an image with a certain rhythm that helps to hold it all together. Hierarchy in this case will be established by one layer being picked out in some way, perhaps by light or by it containing a strong element that anchors the entire scene.

**The Arrow**

![[Pasted image 20210922213520.png]]

Similar to The Plunge, this pattern leads the eye into the background, but in this case using diagonal lines that may leave room for negative space or for an area of texture in the foreground. The lines may be literal (that is, solid lines) or suggestive (that is, made up of repeating elements that cohere into lines), and they will typically emanate out of the lower corners or else near to them. Whatever area the diagonal lines point towards will become the focus of attention, so it is usually best if the viewer can find something interesting there.

**The Hub**

![[Pasted image 20210922213559.png]]

This pattern is characterized by a multitude of strong lines or forms all converging on a single element. The directional forces may originate in any area of the frame, and there may be any number of them, but a strong element will hold them all together.

**The Wallpaper**

![[Pasted image 20210922213751.png]]

“Thick Skin” (2016). The overall sameness of a Wallpaper pattern invites the discovery of differences among the details. In this photograph from a desert playa, the frame is filled only with mud tiles, but variations in the tiles provide plenty of diversity. Some of the tiles bear pockmarks from rain drops, some are developing a peeling surface, some curl up at the edges, and no two have the same shape. Many people have told me that this photograph reminds them of chocolate, and I originally saw an evocation of snakeskin, making the image an example of the Simile pattern as well the Wallpaper.  

The first impression that a Wallpaper pattern provides is one of sameness: at first glance, the viewer sees a frame filled with repeating elements, but closer inspection allows appreciation of variations among the features. For example, a frame filled with a field of mud tiles may at first seem repetitive, but the repetition invites comparison of one tile with the next, and finding subtle differences between them all becomes a delightful game for the eye. The Wallpaper pattern tends to work best when there is nothing very anomalous in the frame to distract from the overall sense of sameness.


**The Mandala**

![[Pasted image 20210922213837.png]]

“High Sodium” (2018). The trefoil shape at the center of this patch of salt formations is surrounded by repeating elements in a roughly concentric design, making it an example of the Mandala pattern. It is also representative of a Wallpaper pattern because everything in the frame is a salt formation. Lastly, the warm light of a low sun is picking out the tallest tubes, contrasting those forms against the rest of the scene that remains bathed in the cool hues of shadowed areas, so this photo could be considered an example of a Binary as well.  

A Mandala is a radial pattern that features a central area of interest and a high level of symmetry, often with concentric forms that provide a strong sense of repetition and balance. It is essentially a frame or zone around a central node that contrasts the ideas of repetition (the outer zone) and emphasis (the core). This contrast makes the Mandala especially expressive, inviting conceptual readings that transcend the literal presentation of whatever natural elements actually appear in the photograph. Such concepts include limitlessness, protection, a journey to a divine center, the inner self, or a source of energy, but of course possible readings are as numerous as the examples of Mandala patterns that occur in nature.

**The Binary**

![[Pasted image 20210922213914.png]]

“Broad Brush” (2017). This photo of dappled light playing across a pond sets up a number of contrasts: reeds versus water, lit versus unlit, and warm versus cool hues. Any one of these contrasts could constitute a Binary distinction. Also, because the lit reeds remind me of flames, I see this photo as an example of the Simile pattern as well.  

The Binary works on the principle of ‘_this_ versus _that_,’ framing a duality of sorts, an instance of two elements or two qualities of an element that are converging or intermingling in nature. Because the Binary essentially sets up a comparison, it is more of an idea than a particular visual pattern. Examples might include foliage set against water, reflective ripples versus transparent ones, or a juxtaposition of plant species. For the Binary to be especially exciting, it helps if the two contrasting features have something in common that creates a sense of irony, allowing the viewer to appreciate the fact that the differences can appear together in the same frame. Two features with little in common (such as a foreign element placed alongside something else unnaturally) can create meaningful combinations in some cases, but such disparate pairings are often confusing for viewers. Likewise, viewers will be more apt to appreciate a Binary that excludes or minimizes any extraneous features, thereby allowing the eye to notice the essence of the comparison right away.

**The Simile**

![[Pasted image 20210922213955.png]]

“Rip Curl” (2016). The upper layer of dried mud in this scene has flowing and dithering forms that remind me of surf crashing on a beach. Because it evokes a subject other than what is depicted, this photo is an example of the Simile pattern. It is also a good example of the Binary pattern because it emphasizes two contrasting qualities: dry mud versus wet mud.

Very often in nature it is possible to find elements that evoke other subjects when photographed, resulting in an image that suggests something other than what the photograph actually depicts. For example, overlapping layers of mud might resemble surf washing up on a beach, or a pair of blossoms might look like a heart from a certain angle. The viewer’s enjoyment of the Simile derives largely from its appeal to the imagination, providing a delightful “Aha!” moment upon noticing an idea through mere suggestion, or else from first seeing an optical illusion and then identifying the natural elements that actually appear in the photo.
