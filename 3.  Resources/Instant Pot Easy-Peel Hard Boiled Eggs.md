## Instant Pot Easy-Peel Hard Boiled Eggs

Cook Time 4 mins

Pressurizing and natural release 15 mins

Total Time 19 mins

### Ingredients

-   Large eggs, cold from the fridgeâ€”at least 1 egg or as many as will fit in a single layer in your pressure cooker
    

### Method

1.  Prepare the pressure cooker:
    
    Place a steamer basket in the bottom of your pressure cooker. Add 1/2 to 1 inches of water (1 to 2 cups) to the pressure cooker (check your pressure cooker manual for minimal liquid amounts). The water level should be just below the steamer basket.
    
2.  Add all the eggs:
    
    Use cold eggs, straight from the fridge. You can cook as many eggs as you like at one time, but be careful of wedging eggs too firmly against one another or stacking eggs on top of each other since these can cause eggs to crack.
    
3.  Bring the pot up to pressure:
    
    Close the lid on the pressure cooker and make sure the steam valve is set to the "sealed" position. Set the pressure to high and set the timer for 4 minutes for electric pressure cookers (3 minutes for stovetop).
    
    The pressure cooker will take 5 to 10 minutes to come to full pressure and then being cooking. Cooking time begins once the cooker has come to pressure.
    
4.  Let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes:
    
    After cooking is done, let the pressure cooker sit for 5 minutes with the lid on and the steam vent "sealed" to allow steam to begin releasing naturally. (If you're using a stovetop pressure cooker, remove it from heat.)
    
5.  Quick-release the remaining pressure:
    
    After 5 minutes of natural release, carefully flip the steam valve to "venting" and quick-release any remaining pressure.
    
6.  Cool the eggs:
    
    Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water to cool (add ice for more rapid cooling, but ice isn't necessarily for making easy-peel eggs). Change out the water as it warms until the eggs are cool, then refrigerate the eggs until needed.
