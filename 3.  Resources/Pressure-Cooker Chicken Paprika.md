# Pressure-Cooker Chicken Paprika

**TOTAL TIME:** Prep: 15 min. Cook: 15 min. + releasing **YIELD:** 2 servings.

I truly appreciate the speed of the pressure cooker. We use it often to make these tender paprika chicken breasts with a sauce that gets its richness from sour cream. —Holly Ottum, Racine, Wisconsin

## Ingredients

-   2 bone-in chicken breast halves (about 2 pounds)
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   1 cup chicken broth, divided
-   2 teaspoons paprika
-   2 teaspoons tomato paste
-   1 garlic clove, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
-   Dash hot pepper sauce
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   1/2 cup sour cream

## Directions

-   **1.** Place chicken in a 3- or 6-qt. electric pressure cooker; top with onion. In a small bowl, whisk 3/4 cup broth, paprika, tomato paste, garlic, salt, thyme and hot pepper sauce; pour over chicken.
-   **2.** Lock lid; close pressure-release valve. Adjust to pressure-cook on high for 15 minutes. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes; quick-release any remaining pressure. A thermometer inserted into chicken should read at least 165°.
-   **3.** Remove chicken; keep warm. In a small bowl, whisk flour and remaining 1/4 cup broth until smooth; stir into pressure cooker. Select saute setting and adjust for low heat. Simmer, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and slightly reduced, 8-10 minutes. Press cancel; stir in sour cream. Serve with chicken.
