This easy, "set it and forget it" Slow Cooker Pulled Pork comes out so tender and juicy, made from scratch with my homemade BBQ sauce.

Prep Time: 5 minutes mins

Cook Time: 9 hours hrs

Total Time: 9 hours hrs 5 minutes mins

Yield: 8 servings

Course: Dinner, Lunch

Cuisine: American

## Equipment

- Slow Cooker
    

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 lbs boneless pork loin roast (center cut, trimmed)
- 2 tsp red wine vinegar
- 2 tsp Hickory liquid smoke
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 1 cup BBQ sauce (homemade or store bought, plus more for serving)

## Instructions

- Place pork in the slow cooker and season with salt, vinegar, garlic powder and liquid smoke.
    
- Cover and cook low 8 to 12 hours, until tender.
    
- Remove pork and transfer onto a large dish; reserve all the liquid into a cup and set aside.
    
- Shred the pork with two forks and put it back into the slow cooker along with about 3/4 cup of the reserved liquid and the BBQ sauce (for every 3 oz cooked pork, I used 2 tbsp BBQ sauce).
    
- Cook on high 1 more hour.
