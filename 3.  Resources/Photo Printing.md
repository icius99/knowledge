# Mark Metternich Fine Art Priting Workflow 

Work in a Gamut that closely resembles what your printer is capable of.   But not the actual Printer color space!  Adobe 1998, ProPhoto or sRGB.  

For modern day inkjet,  ProPhoto RGB would be the best space to work in

## Monitor Calibration

* Use 6500k, 2.2 Gamma, and shoot for a low low luminance, as low as your monitor can go

## Photoshop

Work on a white background!  This is true for all tools.

## Hard Proof







## Soft Proofing in Camera Raw

Black and White Soft Proofing
http://www.lucasetti.com/blog/Soft-proofing-for-black-and-white-images


**Always work in ProPhoto RBG in 16bit!**

Artifacting is cumulative!

You need to negate multiplicitive artifacting (sharpening)

Anywhere you see it check Black Point Compensation!

Soft Proofing - you load the printer/paper profile and make modifications to the soft proof copy to more closely match what you want.  Requires a calibrated monitor.

**Sharpening Right Before Printing**
