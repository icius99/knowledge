**Ingredients**

-   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
-   1/2 large red onion, diced (1 cup)
-   2 red, yellow or orange bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced into 2-inch-long pieces
-   3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
-   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
-   1 teaspoon dried oregano
-   2 bay leaves
-   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-   1 pound firm or extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
-   1/2 cup no-salt-added or homemade vegetable broth (see related recipe)
-   3 tablespoons tomato paste, preferably double concentrated
-   1/2 cup pitted black olives, such as kalamata or Ni√ßoise, chopped
-   3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley or basil, plus more for garnish
-   1/2 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika (pimenton)
-   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed
-   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
-   8 ounces cooked pasta or 4 cups cooked rice or other grain

  

**Instructions**  

1.  Heat a stove-top pressure cooker (without its lid) over medium heat. Add the oil; once it shimmers, add the onion and peppers; cook, uncovered, until the peppers start to soften, 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, rosemary, dried oregano and bay leaves; cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the vinegar and tofu.  
      
    
2.  Stir in the broth. Spoon the tomato paste into the pot, but do not stir. Lock the lid on the pressure cooker. Increase the heat to high and bring the cooker to high pressure, then return the heat to medium to maintain the pressure. Cook for 3 minutes, then quick-release the pressure. Remove the lid, carefully tilting it to direct any steam away from you  
      
    
3.  Stir in the olives, chopped parsley or basil, smoked paprika and the 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Lock the lid back on the cooker (without pressure); let the mixture sit for 3 minutes.  
      
    
4.  Discard the bay leaves. Taste, and add more salt and pepper, as needed. Divide the pasta or grains among serving bowls, spoon one-quarter of the tofu mixture on each, garnish with parsley, and serve.
