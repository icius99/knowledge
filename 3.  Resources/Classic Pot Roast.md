- 6 thinly sliced garlic cloves
- 1 cup red wine
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 6 cups [beef stock](https://www.billyparisi.com/homemade-beef-stock-recipe/)
- 2 bay leaves
- 8 to 10 sprigs fresh thyme
- 8-10 fresh parsley stems with leaves
- 2 pounds baby Yukon potatoes
- 6 peeled regular or 10 baby tri-colored carrots cut into 2” inch pieces
- 4 ribs of celery cut into 2” inch pieces
- 2 peeled parsnips, cut into 2” inch pieces
- 1 peeled rutabaga cut into 1” cubes
- 1/2 [beurre manié recipe](https://www.billyparisi.com/beurre-manie-recipe/)
- Worcestershire sauce to taste
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- coarse salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste
- optional finely minced parsley for garnish

### Instructions

- Generously season the beef on all sides with salt.
    
- Place on a rack over a sheet tray and place uncovered in the refrigerator for 12 to 48 hours.
    
- Remove the beef from the fridge and season with pepper on all sides.
    
- Add the olive oil to a large Dutch oven pot over high heat until it smokes lightly.
    
- Place in the beef, turn the heat down to medium, and sear on all sides until it is golden brown all around. This will take 3 to 4 minutes per side.
    
- Set the beef aside on a plate and add the onions and leeks, season with salt, and sauté for 4 to 6 minutes. Then, turn the heat down to low medium and continue cooking for 10 minutes or until the onions are well browned.
    
- Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, which takes 30 to 45 seconds.
    
- Deglaze with ¼ cup of wine and cook until it is completely absorbed.
    
- Next, stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it is incorporated into the vegetables.⅘
    
- Pour in the ¾ cup wine, beef stock, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.
    
- Add back in the seared beef and bring the mixture to a boil. Add on a lid, place it on a rack in the lower third of the oven, and cook at 325° for 3 ½ to 4 hours or until fork tender and has an internal temperature of 200° to 210°.
    
- With about 70 minutes left in the cooking process, add the potatoes, prepared carrots, celery, and any other vegetables to the pot along with the beef and finish cooking alongside the pot roast.
    
- Remove the pot from the oven and carefully set aside only the beef roast. Mix softened butter and flour to make a beurre manie.
    
- Add the beurre manie to the pot with the liquid and vegetables and cook over low to medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens like a gravy.
    
- Finish the mixture by stirring in optional vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.
    
- Add the beef back to the pot and serve.
    

### Notes

**Make-Ahead:** You can make this up to 1 hour ahead of time. Keep it warm, covered over very low heat.

**How to Store:** Cover and keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Cover and keep in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw for 1 whole day before reheating.

**How to Reheat:** Add your desired portion of pot roast and vegetables to a small pot and cook over low heat until hot. Be sure to stir occasionally.

**I used** a 2 ½ gallon Dutch oven pot. No matter the material, any large pot will work for this recipe.

**The vegetables** do not need to be submerged in the liquid as they cook.

**This goes** from a regular pot roast to a Yankee pot roast when adding vegetables later so they do not overcook.
