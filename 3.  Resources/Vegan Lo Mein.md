### Ingredients

#### Lo Mein Sauce

- 1/4 cup [low sodium soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2EPiAGY) tamari for gluten free
- 1 tablespoon [granulated sugar](https://amzn.to/2LfRABt)
- 2 teaspoons [toasted sesame oil](https://amzn.to/3HV2KKp)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce more to taste

#### The Rest

- 8 ounces [udon wheat noodles](https://amzn.to/42WZjfW) or rice noodles for gluten free*
- 2 tablespoons high-heat safe oil I used avocado oil
- 2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms
- 1 small white onion thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper seeded and thinly sliced
- 1 medium carrot shredded or julienne
- 4 large cloves garlic minced
- chopped green onions optional

### Instructions

- In a small bowl, whisk together all sauce ingredients. Set aside.
    
- In a large pot of boiling water, cook the noodles according to package instructions. Drain well and set aside.
    
- Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, onion, red pepper and carrot and cook, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes until tender. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 more minutes.
    
- Stir in the cooked, drained noodles and sauce. Toss gently to combine. Stir in some some chopped green onions, if desired.
    
- Serve immediately. Leftovers are great the next day, but the lo mein will only last 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Reheat leftovers in the microwave or stovetop until warm and add a splash of soy sauce/tamari if desired. I don't recommend freezing.
    

### Notes

1. You can add [Pan Fried Tofu](https://www.noracooks.com/fried-tofu/) or [Marinated Tofu](https://www.noracooks.com/marinated-tofu/) if desired, for extra protein and deliciousness.
    
2. For gluten free, use gluten free rice noodles and gluten free tamari instead of soy sauce.
    
3. You can even use spaghetti or linguine, but I prefer the udon wheat noodles.
    
4. Mix and match the veggies to your liking. I also like adding broccoli sometimes.
