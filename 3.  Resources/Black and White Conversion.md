1.  Only go to black and white after you have done all of your other processing.  A beautiful color image should be underneath

2.  Apply a Gradient Map.  Shouldn't go from pure black to pure white.   Something more like RGB 5,5,5 to RGB 250, 250, 250.  Adjust as needed.

3. Add an HSL adjustment layer above color image.  Use the eyedropper to select colors in the image and adjust sliders to improve the black and white image.    

4.  Use a Selective Color adjustment layer beneath the HSL layer to super refine color adjustment in Highlights, Midtones and Shadows.

5. Go back into Gradient Map and move the middle anchor point to adjust the high key/low key balance.
