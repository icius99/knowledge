### Ingredients

- 14.5 ounce block firm tofu or extra-firm
- 1/4 cup [Vegan Mayo](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-mayo/)
- 1 teaspoon yellow mustard
- 1 1/2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
- 2 teaspoons sweet relish
- 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
- tiny pinch turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon [black salt](https://amzn.to/43IxQxg) or regular salt, + more to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 green onion, white and light green parts, thinly sliced
- loaf of bread, butter lettuce for serving

### Instructions

- **Press the tofu:** Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels or a clean tea towel. Place something heavy on top of it, like a cast iron pan, and let it sit for 20 minutes.
    
- **Make the dressing:** While the tofu presses, whisk together the vegan mayo[](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-mayo/), yellow mustard, dill pickle juice, sweet relish, smoked paprika, turmeric, salt and black pepper. Set aside.
    
- **Slice the tofu:** Once the tofu is pressed, slice the block into thin strips, then slice thinly the other way. Chop into even smaller pieces.
    
- Add the tofu to the bowl with the creamy dressing, along with the sliced green onions. Stir well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes if possible before eating, to let the flavors meld together. Serve on bread of choice with butter lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts and whatever else you like. Enjoy!
    

### Notes

1. Store leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.
2. To make it without tofu, you could probably scramble up a bottle of JUST Egg, then mix it with the dressing.

After pressing the tofu, slice the block into thin, rectangular strips.

Pile the strips on top of each other, then, in the opposite direction, slice them into smaller pieces. Don’t worry about making them all the same uniform size!

To make the dressing, whisk the vegan mayo, mustard, pickle juice, sweet relish, and dry spices together in a large mixing bowl.

Add the chopped tofu pieces to the bowl with the dressing, along with the sliced green onions. Stir to coat. 

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge so the salad can chill for about 30 minutes. Afterward, serve the salad in sandwiches, on salad, or as a delicious snack!

## Tips for success

- Always press the tofu to drain the excess water. Skipping this step could leave you with watery egg salad, and no one wants that. You can do this using a tofu press or by wrapping the brick in paper towels (or a clean tea towel) and placing something heavy on top. Let it sit and drain for at least 20 minutes.
- Finely dicing the tofu into small, pea-sized pieces is the secret to the realistic egg-like texture. If you’d rather simply crumble the tofu, that’s fine too.
- If you have the time, chill the assembled salad in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving. This gives all of the amazing flavors time to get to know each other, yielding a much more flavorful salad!
- You can make the egg salad dressing up to 1 week in advance. Just mix the ingredients together and store the dressing in an airtight container in the fridge until it’s time to serve.

## Variations

There’s lots of room for add-ins in vegan egg salad! Check out these tasty suggestions:

- **Herbs** – For a more vibrant flavor, stir fresh dill and/or chives into the egg salad mixture. 
- **Veggies** – Feel free to add finely diced red onion or celery, shaved carrots, or halved cherry tomatoes for extra crunch and texture.
- **Vegan bacon** – Crumbled [tofu](https://www.noracooks.com/tofu-bacon/) or [tempeh](https://www.noracooks.com/smoky-baked-tempeh-bacon/) bacon will give it a smoky, savory twist.
- **Black salt** – Black salt or kala namak will give the salad an even more intense eggy, sulfur-like flavor. I usually use this for a more “eggy” salad.

## Serving suggestions

The best way to put this vegan egg salad recipe to use is in vegan egg salad sandwiches. Top the sandwiches with lettuce leaves, sliced avocado, [pickled red onions](https://www.noracooks.com/pickled-red-onions/), radishes, sliced tomatoes, then dig in!

You can also use the egg salad as a topping on salad greens or stuff it into lettuce wraps. Serve it alongside [Vegan Potato Salad](https://www.noracooks.com/oil-free-vegan-classic-potato-salad/) or [Vegan Coleslaw](https://www.noracooks.com/classic-vegan-coleslaw/) for a complete (and delicious) meal or picnic.

And if you end up with leftovers, scoop them up with crackers for a quick, easy, and protein-packed snack!

## Frequently asked questions

****What kind of tofu is best for tofu egg salad?****

Extra firm or firm tofu is best because it contains the least amount of water. Watery varieties, like medium, soft, or silken tofu, won’t work as well and could leave you with soggy egg salad.

****Does it taste like real eggs?****

A lot of commenters can attest that the taste is just like real egg salad! However, you can give it an even stronger “eggy” taste by stirring black salt (kala namak) in place of or in addition to the regular salt in the dressing.

****How long does tofu egg salad last in the refrigerator?****

It will last for 4 to 5 days in the fridge when it’s stored in an airtight container.

****Can you freeze vegan egg salad?****

No, do not freeze tofu egg salad! Once it thaws, the tofu will release a lot of liquid, which will water it down and ruin the creamy consistency.

**Can I make it without tofu?**

You could scramble up a bottle of JUST Egg, then mix it with the dressing for a tofu-free vegan egg salad.
