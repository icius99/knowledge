### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pound beef chuck roast boneless, sliced into thin strips
- 1 cup beef consomme or beef broth
- 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- Frozen Broccoli Florets about 3 cups (I used one 14 oz bag)

### Instructions

- In a mixing bowl, whisk together the beef consume, soy sauce, dark brown sugar, sesame oil, and garlic.
    
- Lay the beef strips in the crockpot and pour the sauce over, tossing the strips to coat.
    
- Turn the crockpot on low and cook for about 6 hours. Mine was ready at 5. You don't want to cook the beef too long or it will start to shred.
    
- About an hour before it is done, take 1/4 cup of the sauce and whisk it in a small bowl with the cornstarch. Slowly stir this into the crockpot. Add in the broccoli the last 30 minutes and let the broccoli cook through. You don't want to add the broccoli until the very end or it will be mushy.
    
- Serve over white rice and enjoy!!
