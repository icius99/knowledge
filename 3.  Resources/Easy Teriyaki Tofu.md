### Ingredients

#### For the tofu

- 14.5 ounce block extra-firm tofu
- 1 tablespoon [low sodium soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2EPiAGY)
- 2 tablespoons [cornstarch](https://amzn.to/2Bio0Ij)
- 2 tablespoons canola oil or other high-heat safe oil

#### For the teriyaki sauce

- 1/4 cup [low sodium soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2EPiAGY)
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar or maple syrup, agave
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water

#### For serving

- [cooked rice](https://www.noracooks.com/basmati-rice/) or quinoa, cooked rice noodles
- steamed or roasted broccoli or other vegetable
- sesame seeds, optional
- chopped green onions, optional

### Instructions

- **Press the tofu:** Press the tofu by wrapping it in paper towels (or a clean dry tea towel). Place a plate or pan on top of the wrapped tofu, and put a couple of heavy books or cast iron pan on top of that. Let the tofu press for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour.
    
- **Prepare the teriyaki sauce:** In a medium bowl, add the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, seasoned rice vinegar, ginger and garlic. Stir to combine and set aside while you make the tofu.
    
- Rip the tofu into bite sized pieces (or simply cut into squares, rectangles or triangles) and add to a large bowl. Drizzle the soy sauce on top and stir gently with a silicone spatula or small spoon. Be careful not to rip the tofu.
    
- Now sprinkle on the cornstarch and gently stir it again to coat the tofu.
    
- Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil to coat the pan.
    
- Once the oil is hot, add the tofu in a single layer (do this in batches if needed). Let the tofu get crispy and golden on all sides. I use a fork to gently flip each piece over. **TIP:** When you place the layer of tofu in the pan, don't touch or move it at all for a few minutes, so a crust can form, making it easier to flip without ripping.
    
- Once the tofu is golden, turn the heat down to low heat. Stir the teriyaki sauce in the bowl once more before pouring it into the pan with the tofu. Bring to simmer and cook for a minute or two.
    
- In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and water, then add to the pan. Stir constantly until the sauce thickens.
    
- Serve with steamed or roasted broccoli and cooked rice. Enjoy!
    

### Notes

1. **Gluten free:** Use gluten free tamari instead of soy sauce.
2. **Bake the tofu instead:** Chunk the tofu, then add them to a large bowl, along with the soy sauce and cornstarch. Stir gently to coat. Arrange the tofu evenly on the prepared pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for about 15 minutes, then flip the pieces over. They should be lightly golden and crisp. Prepare the sauce on the stove, then add the tofu.
3. **Storing leftovers:** Store for up to 4 days in the refrigerator. It can also be frozen if needed.
