# My Plan

1. I will day trade the Micro Nasdaq Futures contract (MNQ)
2. My trading hours are 6pm - Midnight EST
3. I will trade on the 1 min chart
4. I will analyze the 15 min and 1 hour charts to determine trends or ranging.
5. Trading above the 89 period SMA on the higher timeframes means bullish and vice versa.
6. I will swing trade the 1 min chart in the direction of the trend (i.e. get in on a retracement)
7.  I will NOT trade against the trend.
8. If the market is in a trading range,  I will not trade it.
9. If I get a confirmed reversal in the trend or a breakout from a trading range in the direction of the overall trend,  I WILL look to trade that.
10. I will consider trend lines and horizontal lines of resistance as possible clues about price action,  but not as ironclad predictors.
11. I will use larger patterns (i.e. double tops) to signal potential opportunities.
12. I will use my list of candlestick patterns to signal potential opportunities.
13. I will only risk 1% of my account value per trade.
14. Once I hit 5% of my day start account value in drawdown in a day, I will stop trading.
15. I will exit all trades before ending my trading session regardless of their success or failure.
16. I will always trade with a stop loss.  
17. I WILL be patient!
18. I will not take profits too early!
19. Fear is the mind killer!
20. I WILL have fun!




# To Do

30 TRADES!  

Learn the double top!!

Figure out the ABCD pattern

Analyze and understand every losing trade!! What can you learn from it?

Figure out what you're gonna do when you lose internet connection!!!

Markets will go to obvious stops most of the time!!  


# Notes

GOOD trading WILL make you uncomfortable!

Tom Says: Technical analysis really only has forecasting power for the next 2 to 3 bars?? Need to explore this.

BE PRESENT!!

Surrender to the market!

You can't let past trades make you hesitate to execute your strategy without fail!

ANYTHING can happen on one trade.

I always want to put my entries where other traders put their stop orders.

If it feels like you want to take profits,  it’s probably time to add on.  If you feel like you don’t want to take the loss,  you probably should


Max Daily loss is personal,  you need to decide what it should be.

If you are getting chewed up by chop in a short time frame,  zoom out to a higher timeframe and get the bigger picture.

Adding on to winning positions!

Tom's technique for moving stop loss.  If the next bar makes a new low/high and the close of the next bar closes below/above the previous bar.

Like here the second bar closed in the above conditions so the stop was moved down to the red line

Carefully consider every bar!! What does it mean?
You have to be able to lose well!  Even Trader Tom is only 60% right at best.  
Add on to your winning positions!  How will I do this?
The only thing you can control is risk, stop loss, entry and emotions.
You still suck!!  Don't worry about it,  just keep at it.
Don't revenge trade!
Know when to take a break!
